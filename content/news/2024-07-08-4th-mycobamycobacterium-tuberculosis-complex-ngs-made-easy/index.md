title: 4th Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex NGS made easy

---
Tuberculosis (TB) is a big killer in many countries of the world, particularly in those with low and middle income. Next-generation sequencing has been key in improving our understanding of drug resistance acquisition and of transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Yet, the need for expertise guiding NGS implementation in laboratories and the lack of bioinformatic expertise, are main obstacles hindering the implementation of NGS into TB programs.
