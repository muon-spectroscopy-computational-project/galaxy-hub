Many GTN tutorials already have recordings. These recordings were made by members of the community for a variety of (online) training events. Up until now, this video library were part of the Gallantries Project. We have now integrated this video library directly into the GTN, and made it even easier to add video recordings to GTN tutorials or slide decks! Just use a Google Form to submit your video recordings!
