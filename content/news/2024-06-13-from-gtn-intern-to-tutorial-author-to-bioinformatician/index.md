title: From GTN Intern to Tutorial Author to Bioinformatician

---
With growing access and interest in sequencing data, Galaxy is a knight in shining armor for wet lab scientists hoping to analyze their own data. With long term intentions of increasing access to bioinformatic analyses, the Galaxy Training Network (GTN) creates a safe space where non-computer-scientists may analyze their own data and even learn to code: an invaluable skill in todayâ€™s scientific world. Galaxy introduced me to brand new skills as an undergraduate and ultimately changed the trajectory of my career. Here is my story as a biology undergraduate with no coding experience turned GTN contributor &amp;, eventually, coding bioinformatician: thanks to Galaxy.
