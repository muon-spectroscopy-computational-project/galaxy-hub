Thanks to the efforts undertaken in the EuroScienceGateway project, Galaxy now offers integration with Onedata. It can be used as a remote source for data import/export (a.k.a. Files Source Plugin) and as a storage location for Galaxy datasets (an Object Store). The integration includes BYOD (Bring Your Own Data) and BYOS (Bring Your Own Storage) templates.
