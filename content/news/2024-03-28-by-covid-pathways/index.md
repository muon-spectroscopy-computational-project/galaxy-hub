As part of the work of BeYond COVID, we have developed a new integration between the MINERVA Platform’s COVID-19 Disease Map and Galaxy! Datasets created within Galaxy can now be seamlessly visualized in the MINERVA Platform, allowing you to explore your data in the context of the COVID-19 Disease Map.
